* *VMWare* may be a better choice if a bare-metal hypervisor is needed for a massive, enterprise-level organization that can sustain larger costs. Furthermore, if there are comprehensive support needs for diverse operating systems and a desire to host various third-party utilities in an interconnected environment, VMWare may be the more sensible choice.
* *HyperV* may be a better choice for organizations that run on Windows and would prefer to rely on Windows management utilities, and if cost consciousness is high.
