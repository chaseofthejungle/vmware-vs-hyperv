# VMWare and Hyper-V Overview Guide

**Description/Overview:** VMWare (unless otherwise mentioned, this article is specifically in reference to *vSphere* and *ESXi*, a foundational technology upon which *vSphere* is built) and Microsoft's *Hyper-V* are bare-metal hypervisors that create virtual machines (VMs). Both VMWare technologies and Hyper-V are common solutions for professional deployments, but they have more than a few key differences (such as their operating environments, costs, and integrations with guest OSes). While most VMWare solutions are intended for mid-to-large scale organizations (which may be more capable of paying expensive licensing fees) with a diversity of operating system needs and compatibilities (e.g., Windows, MacOS, various Linux distributions), Hyper-V is a common free solution for Windows-specific OS environments.

## 4. <a name="choosing">Choosing a Bare-Metal Hypervisor</a>

* *VMWare* may be a better choice if a bare-metal hypervisor is needed for a massive, enterprise-level organization that can sustain larger costs. Furthermore, if there are comprehensive support needs for diverse operating systems and a desire to host various third-party utilities in an interconnected environment, VMWare may be the more sensible choice.
* *HyperV* may be a better choice for organizations that run on Windows and would prefer to rely on Windows management utilities, and if cost consciousness is high.
